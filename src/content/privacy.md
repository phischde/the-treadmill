# Privacy

Your privacy matters to me — this is a short story site, not an ad network.

This page explains what little data I process and why I process it.

## What I Measure

I use [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) to understand how people read *The Treadmill* — which pages are opened, how far readers scroll, and what gets downloaded. This helps me improve the site and nothing else.

## Hosting

This site is hosted on a server located in Germany. All data is processed within the EU and not shared with third parties.

### Legal Basis

The processing is based on **legitimate interest** (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO) to operate and improve the website. When you give cookie consent, the legal basis becomes **consent** (Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO).

### Cookieless Mode

By default, Matomo runs in a **cookieless mode**:

- No persistent identifiers
- IP address is truncated before storage
- I respect your browser’s **Do Not Track** setting
- No cross-site tracking or advertising cookies

This gives me anonymous, aggregate numbers like “120 people read to the end this week”.

## Optional Cookies

If you click **“Yes, I’m cool”** in the consent bubble, I enable Matomo’s first-party cookies on [treadmill.phisch.de](https://treadmill.phisch.de/). This lets me:

- Estimate returning readers
- Better understand how reading patterns change over time

Rejecting keeps Matomo in cookieless mode — nothing on the site stops working.

You can change your choice at any time:

<p>
  <button id="reset-consent" type="button" class="button button--ghost">Reset consent now</button>
</p>

<noscript>
If JavaScript is disabled, clear this site’s data in your browser settings to reset your choice.
</noscript>

## Data Recipients & Transfers

Analytics data is processed only by me and stored in Germany. No data is shared with third parties or transferred outside the EU.

## Data Retention

I keep detailed visit logs for a maximum of 6 months and aggregated statistics for 18 months. Older data is deleted automatically.

## Data Controller

**Philippe Schrettenbrunner**  
Berrschestr. 13  
81245 München  
Deutschland
