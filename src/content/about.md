# About

## The Author

Hi, I'm Philippe Schrettenbrunner. I work as a Software Architect and Cybersecurity Specialist, focusing on the secure design of systems that integrate AI. This gives me a front-row seat to how quickly emerging technologies go from concept to critical infrastructure — and how the decisions we make early can shape the systems we all depend on.

## Why I Wrote This

*The Treadmill* started during one of those late-night conversations with friends and chatbots where you suddenly see a new angle to an old problem. Patterns began to emerge: how each efficiency breakthrough creates more demand, how moving forward is humanity’s default mode, how the smartest solutions often turn into the most elegant traps.

This isn’t another “AI turns evil” story — they’re overused. In this story, the machines never betray us. What brought humanity to its peak can’t carry it beyond — the very strategies that made us successful become the chains that bind us. The story asks what happens when our oldest problems — the ones wired into our neurons — scale up to planetary physics.

I developed these ideas through extensive dialogues with ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, turning them into both collaborators and proof of concept. I am fully aware of the irony... using the very acceleration I’m describing to craft the story: every brainstorming ran on remote servers, every generated image left a tiny heat signature somewhere. While I wrote the text, an AI agent built this website.

This is a thought experiment, not a forecast. It’s meant to provoke reflection, not predict catastrophe.

## The Story

*The Treadmill* is fiction, but the constraints are real. The physics of heat dissipation, the mathematics of coordination failures, the psychology of enhancement addiction — these aren’t speculation. They are the fundamentals.

I’ve woven ideas from economics, psychology, physics, and game theory throughout the narrative. You might enjoy spotting them — or you might just let the story stand on its own, a simple question about whether wisdom can evolve as fast as capability.

Welcome to the treadmill.  
We’re already running...
