# About the Science

While *The Treadmill* is speculative fiction, not a forecast, the scientific principles and social dynamics it explores
are grounded in real research and observable patterns.

## The Physics

### Planetary Heat Limits

Every watt of energy we use eventually becomes waste heat. Earth radiates this heat into space following the
Stefan-Boltzmann law (proportional to the fourth power of temperature). But there's a hard limit: if we generate heat
faster than Earth can radiate it away, the planet's temperature must rise. This isn't climate change from greenhouse
gases; it's pure thermodynamics from energy use itself. At current growth rates of global energy consumption (about 2%
annually), we'd hit these thermal limits within a few centuries, far sooner than the sun's evolution would affect us.

### The Kardashev Scale

Proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964, this scale measures civilizations by their energy consumption.
A Type I civilization harnesses all available planetary energy. The story explores what happens when a species
approaches this threshold without leaving their home planet. The transition from Type 0 to Type I might be the most
dangerous phase in any civilization's development, requiring massive energy infrastructure while still confined to a
single world's thermal constraints.

### Exponential Computing Growth

Computing power has historically doubled every 18-24 months (Moore's Law), while AI capabilities are currently improving
even faster. The story extrapolates what happens when this exponential growth meets physical limits. Training each new
generation of AI models already requires exponentially more compute: GPT-4 used roughly 100 times more compute than
GPT-3, a pattern that can't continue indefinitely without hitting fundamental barriers.

### Fusion Energy

Nuclear fusion, the process that powers stars, has been "20 years away" since the 1950s. Recent breakthroughs suggest it
might finally be within reach. The story imagines AI solving the remaining engineering challenges, delivering clean,
abundant energy that ironically enables the final spiral. The paradox is real: solving our energy problems without
solving our coordination problems might accelerate rather than prevent certain existential risks.

## The Human Dynamics

### The Prisoner's Dilemma at Scale

Game theory shows how rational actors can get trapped in suboptimal outcomes. When every nation knows that pausing AI
development means losing competitive advantage, no one can afford to stop, even when everyone sees the collective
danger. This isn't a failure of intelligence but a tragedy of coordination, with each player making locally rational
decisions that lead to globally catastrophic outcomes.

### Technological Dependency

Societies become dependent on their infrastructure. Once critical systems require AI to function, stepping back becomes
impossible without accepting immediate collapse, a pattern we already see in smaller scales with digital infrastructure.
The story's thirteen-hour blackout echoes real events: when GPS systems fail, modern agriculture struggles; when payment
networks go down, commerce halts within hours.

### Jevons Paradox

When technology becomes more efficient, we often use more of it rather than less. The story applies this to AI: as it
becomes cheaper to run, it becomes ubiquitous, ultimately consuming more resources than ever. We've seen this with every
major efficiency improvement in history. More efficient car engines led to more driving, not less fuel consumption; LED
bulbs led to more lighting, not less electricity use.

### Competitive Dynamics and Arms Races

Military and economic competition has historically driven nations to pursue advantages despite collective risks. The
story extends this pattern to AI development, where first-mover advantages create unstoppable momentum. The Cold War
nuclear arms race provides a template: nations built enough weapons to destroy the world many times over, not because it
made sense, but because not building them seemed even more dangerous.

### The Fermi Paradox

If the universe is vast and old, where is everybody? The Fermi Paradox highlights the puzzling silence of the cosmos
despite the high probability of other civilizations existing. The story offers one possible answer: intelligent species
might regularly enhance themselves into extinction before achieving interstellar reach. Perhaps the universe isn't
empty. It's full of civilizations that burned too bright and too fast.

### The Great Filter

The Great Filter hypothesis suggests there's some nearly insurmountable challenge that prevents life from spreading
throughout the universe. Most hope the filter is behind us, perhaps the jump to multicellular life or the evolution of
intelligence. But what if it's ahead? The story presents intelligent tool use combined with poor coordination as a
candidate for this filter, a challenge that every technological species must face and most fail.

*The intersection of these real principles creates the thought experiment: What if our drive for intelligence
enhancement collided with the physical limits of our planet? The answer might depend less on the technology itself and
more on our ability to coordinate as a species.*
